            Dear Colleagues, Scholars, and Research Partners,
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It is my great honor to welcome you to the CISMA Conference
            Platform- an academic space founded with a clear purpose: to bring
            together the brightest minds working at the intersection of corpus
            linguistics, natural language processing, discourse studies,
            translation, and interpreting.
            <br />
            In an age where digital technologies, big data, and AI increasingly
            shape how societies communicate, understand one another, and
            negotiate meaning, our responsibility as researchers has never been
            more critical. The CISMA platform was established to respond to this
            moment. It is built on the conviction that rigorous empirical
            inquiry, methodological innovation, and interdisciplinary dialogue
            are essential to understanding the complex linguistic and
            communicative landscapes of our time.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            CISMA is more than a conference; it is a collaborative global
            network. It brings together early career researchers, senior
            academics, technologists, and professional practitioners who share a
            commitment to exploring how digital tools and corpus driven methods
            can deepen our understanding of language, power, culture, and
            society. Our mission is to cultivate research that is theoretically
            robust, methodologically transparent, and socially meaningful.
            <br />I encourage you to join us in advancing this intellectual
            journey. Whether your work focuses on discourse and society,
            computational linguistics, translation technologies, sentiment
            analysis, digital humanities, or interdisciplinary approaches to
            language, CISMA offers a platform where your ideas can grow, be
            challenged, and make an impact.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Together, we can build a scholarly community that not only responds
            to today&apos;s challenges but also shapes the future of language
            sciences- a future defined by innovation, collaboration, and shared
            academic curiosity.
            <br />I look forward to welcoming you, learning from your insights,
            and working with you to strengthen our collective contribution to
            global scholarship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Warm regards,
            <br />

            &quot; CISMA was not born in a meeting room or through a formal
            proposal. It began as an idea, quiet, persistent, and shaped by
            years of encountering a simple but powerful truth: language research
            was changing, and the academic world needed a space that could
            change with it.&quot;
