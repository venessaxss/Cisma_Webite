    description:
      "Amid the growing movement of post-publication peer review, retractions are increasingly serving as a vital mechanism for correcting the academic record. However, despite being a key indicator of research integrity issues, the mechanics and implications of retractions remain unfamiliar to many researchers, particularly those in the social sciences and humanities. In this talk, I will draw on the Retraction Watch Database to map the salient characteristics of global retractions, including their prevalence, underlying reasons, time lags, authorship patterns, and distribution across geographic locations and academic disciplines. Building on this empirical foundation, I will provide an overview of the current landscape of retraction research and identify critical directions for future inquiry. Crucially, this talk will translate these macro-level trends into practical insights. I will highlight the negative consequences of retractions, including potential sanctions for accountable parties, and conclude with actionable advice for grassroots researchers. Specifically, I will discuss how to appropriately handle research integrity allegations, respond to retraction requests, manage citations of retracted literature, and navigate collaborations with researchers who have (co-)authored retracted publications.",
    speakerBio:
      "Shaoxiong Brian Xu (徐少雄) is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of English and Communication at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Since 2017, his research has focused on the phenomenon of academic retractions.

      "Language education today is encountering both new opportunities and important challenges in the age of artificial intelligence. While educators need to take a critical view of how AI is incorporated into classroom teaching and research, it is increasingly difficult to avoid engaging with AI in meaningful ways. Developing critical AI literacy has therefore become especially important, particularly in English-medium instruction (EMI) contexts where issues of language, access, and participation are closely intertwined. This talk presents a classroom-based case study of integrating an AI chatbot into a university course on language and culture. It explores how both teachers and students worked with AI in practical ways to support learning. The findings show that students actively exercised agency by designing their own chatbot roles and using multilingual and multimodal translanguaging strategies to make sense of course content and communicate ideas more effectively. These practices helped create a more supportive and flexible learning space while also encouraging reflection on language use and identity. The talk concludes by suggesting that translanguaging-informed approaches can help educators make more thoughtful use of AI to support multilingual and equitable education, and to further develop students' global competence in EMI classrooms.",

      "This lecture examines the cultural and linguistic significance of Cristina D'Avena, whose extensive repertoire and long-standing career have established her as a central figure in Italian popular culture. While her impact is often attributed to nostalgia, the study argues that this explanation is insufficient. Through the application of corpus-driven methodologies, her influence is instead interpreted as emerging from the interaction of linguistic structure, vocal features, and perceptual responses. The first axis of analysis focuses on the linguistic configuration of Italian cartoon theme songs, shaped in part by Alessandra Valeri Manera. Corpus evidence shows that Italian lyrics tend to be more narrative, descriptive, and value-oriented than their English counterparts, constructing a participatory textual space characterized by recurring themes such as growth, relationships, and optimism. The second axis addresses D'Avena's vocal profile. Acoustic and prosodic analyses identify a stable and recognizable configuration associated with clarity, modulation, and auditory comfort. These findings are supported by audience discourse and preliminary biofeedback data indicating reduced skin conductance during listening. The study proposes that her impact results from a measurable convergence of linguistic, vocal, and perceptual factors, extending beyond nostalgia.",

      "While translanguaging has been extensively studied in educational contexts, its exploration within clinical settings remains limited, particularly with regard to international medical students undergoing internship training. In this study, we investigated multilingual interactions among international medical students, local doctors, and patients in a Chinese hospital, examining how and to what extent translanguaging mediates knowledge asymmetry and epistemic authority in intercultural healthcare communication. Data were collected through a linguistic ethnography conducted in a Chinese teaching hospital and analyzed using conversation analysis, triangulated with interview data, focusing on history-taking and clinical instruction scenarios. Findings reveal that integrating linguistic repertoires, diverse semiotic systems, and spatial resources facilitates the co-construction of medical knowledge. At the same time, while translanguaging can enable temporary negotiations of epistemic authority, its transformative potential remains limited by institutional hierarchies and the highly contextualized nature of medical language. These findings enrich translanguaging theory by emphasizing both its affordances and limitations in diverse professional settings and offer implications for international medical education policy.",

It offers a comprehensive and refined account of movie discourse through the application of Multi-Dimensional Analysis (MDA) to the American Movie Corpus, a collection of authentic, verified movie dialog transcriptions. Expanding on previous MDA-based research, it broadens both the scope of data and the methodological framework by integrating the Grammar of Graphics to facilitate the interpretation of linguistic findings. The study addresses the longstanding debate on the authenticity of scripted dialog, demonstrating the textual and linguistic proximity between movie language and spontaneous conversation. It includes genre-based and diachronic analyses, offering a rigorous, data-driven perspective on movie language as both a linguistic resource and a tool for teaching spoken grammar. Bridging corpus linguistics, applied linguistics, and media studies, the book provides valuable insights for scholars, educators, and learners interested in spoken language, ELT, and telecinematic discourse, while contributing a novel, visualized approach to empirical language analysis.",

At the core of this experiment there was a highly articulated ideology of state nationalism. The latter was embedded in a neoliberal and strongly pro-Western agenda that posited Georgia as a country that had been forcefully detached from its ‘European path’ by the Russian Empire first and the USSR later, therefore its ‘Europeanness’ had to be ‘restored’ by a process of rapid de-Sovietization and de-Russianization coupled with a speedy process of ‘modernization’. This ideology, among other things, found expression in a radical reshaping of the Georgian urban landscape, especially in the cities of Tbilisi and Batumi. This paper uses multimodal CDA tools to analyze one such example of resemantization of the public space, namely the Medea monument in Batumi. The analysis shows how this monument and its architectural setting elides the other interpretations and transforms the figure of Medea into a site of nationalist pedagogy aimed at demonstrating Georgia’s ‘Europeanness’.",

We argue for the latter hypothesis based on the historical context of the southward migration of the Han Chinese. Evidence for the southward Han migration and its influence on Mainland Southeast Asia comes from written history (Fitzgerald 1972), genetics (Wen et al. 2004), archaeology (Wu et al. 2019), and linguistics (Alves 2021). In this presentation, we focus on the linguistic evidence for the southward Han migration, from the perspectives of typology, by analyzing quantitative datasets such as Grambank and Phonotacticon, and historical linguistics, by comparing the earlier stages of Sinitic to the earlier stages of non-Sinitic families of Mainland Southeast Asia.",

        text: "Corpora, structured collections of textual and spoken data serve as the bedrock for understanding human language, enabling breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, sentiment analysis, and beyond. These corpora, meticulously curated and annotated, provide the raw material for training AI systems, empowering them to comprehend, generate, and interact with human language in increasingly sophisticated ways. I will explore how AI has transformed the creation, analysis, and application of language corpora. From automating the annotation of syntactic and semantic structures to enabling the development of large language models (LLMs) like GPT, AI has significantly accelerated the pace of linguistic discovery and innovation. I will highlight real-world examples where AI-driven corpora have powered cutting-edge applications, from voice assistants to real-time translation tools, and discuss how these advancements are reshaping communication across industries. However, this transformative journey is not without challenges. I will address critical issues such as data privacy, bias in corpus construction, and the ethical implications of using linguistic data to train AI systems. Ensuring diversity and representativeness in corpora is paramount to building fair and inclusive AI technologies. I will also emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together linguists, computer scientists, and ethicists to navigate these complexities responsibly. As we stand at the forefront of this exciting era, I will conclude by envisioning the future of language corpora and AI. By harnessing the power of AI while upholding ethical standards, we can unlock unprecedented opportunities for linguistic research, education, and global communication. Join me in exploring how language corpora and AI are not just tools but catalysts for a more connected and understanding world.",
